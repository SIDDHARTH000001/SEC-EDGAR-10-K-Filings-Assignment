    "query": "What percentage of Google's revenue came from cloud in 2023?",
    "answer": "In 2023, Google Cloud generated $33.088 billion in revenue out of Google's total revenue of $307.394 billion. This means that approximately 10.76% of Google's revenue came from Google Cloud in 2023.",
    "reasoning": "To determine the percentage of revenue from Google Cloud, we divide the Google Cloud revenue by the total revenue and multiply by 100. From the context, Google Cloud revenue was $33.088 billion and total revenue was $307.394 billion for 2023. Thus, the percentage is (33.088 / 307.394) * 100 = 10.76%.",

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated. There were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Gross Profit and Gross Margin",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenue We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.
