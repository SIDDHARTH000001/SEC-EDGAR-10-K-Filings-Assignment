    "query": "How did NVIDIA's data center revenue grow from 2022 to 2023?",
    "answer": "NVIDIA's data center revenue grew from $10.613 billion in fiscal year 2022 to $15.005 billion in fiscal year 2023, representing an increase of 41%.",
    "reasoning": "The context provides specific figures for NVIDIA's data center revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. In fiscal year 2022, the revenue was $10.613 billion, and in fiscal year 2023, it increased to $15.005 billion. The percentage increase is calculated as ((15.005 - 10.613) / 10.613) * 100, which equals approximately 41%. This growth was influenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platforms and networking portfolio.",
