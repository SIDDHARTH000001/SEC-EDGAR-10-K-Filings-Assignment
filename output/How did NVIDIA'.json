In Automotive, we started production of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle SOC and introduced next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.",

In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA\u2019s automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers.
