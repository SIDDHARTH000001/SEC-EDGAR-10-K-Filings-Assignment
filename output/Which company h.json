    "answer": "Based on the provided context, only NVIDIA's operating margin for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 (which corresponds to 2023) is explicitly stated as 15.6%. The operating margins for Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) for 2023 are not available in the given excerpts, as the necessary total revenue figures to calculate them are not provided.",
    "reasoning": "The NVDA 2024 filing excerpt states that for the 'Year Ended Jan 29, 2023', the 'Operating income' was '15.6 %'. For GOOGL, the 2023 filing excerpt provides 'Total income from operations' as $84,293 million for 2023, but the total revenue for 2023 is not available to calculate the operating margin. Similarly, the MSFT excerpts do not provide the operating margin or the necessary financial figures to calculate it for 2023.",
