    "query": "Compare AI investments mentioned by all three companies in their 2024 10-Ks",
    "answer": "In their 2024 10-K filings, all three companies\u2014Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Google\u2014highlight their investments in AI as a key strategic focus.\n\n1. **Microsoft**: Microsoft emphasizes its commitment to making digital technology and AI broadly available and doing so responsibly. The company aims to empower every person and organization to achieve more by creating platforms and tools powered by AI, delivering innovative solutions to meet evolving customer needs.\n\n2. **NVIDIA**: NVIDIA reports significant growth in its Data Center revenue, largely driven by AI inference platforms. The company launched AI inference platforms combining its full-stack inference software with processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs, and other AI workloads. NVIDIA also introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models.\n\n3. **Google**: Google continues to invest heavily in its technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support AI products and services. The company views acquisitions and strategic investments as crucial to expanding its offerings and expertise in engineering and other functional areas, building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\nOverall, while all three companies are heavily investing in AI, their approaches differ slightly. Microsoft focuses on empowering users and organizations with AI-driven platforms and tools. NVIDIA is advancing AI inference platforms and processors for specific AI workloads, while Google is enhancing its infrastructure to support AI growth and strategic partnerships.",
    "reasoning": "The context provided from the 2024 10-K filings of Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Google outlines their respective focus areas in AI investments. Microsoft is concentrating on broad availability and responsible use of AI, NVIDIA is enhancing its AI inference platforms and processors, and Google is investing in infrastructure to support AI growth. Each company's strategy reflects its core business model and market position, with Microsoft focusing on user empowerment, NVIDIA on AI hardware and software optimization, and Google on infrastructure and strategic partnerships.",

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased tax benefits of the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.",

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The adverse cash flow impact of mandatory capitalization will be reduced in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.04\u00a0billion in share repurchases and $398 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.",

Fiscal year 2023 also included a $1.4 billion acquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction. Market Platform Highlights Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA\u2019s automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.",
