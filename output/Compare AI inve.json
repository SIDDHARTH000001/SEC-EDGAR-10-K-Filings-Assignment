    "query": "Compare AI investments mentioned by all three companies in their 2024 10-Ks",
    "answer": "In their 2024 10-K filings, Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both highlight increasing investments in AI infrastructure. Google specifies investments in technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support AI products and services, and states an expectation to increase these investments relative to 2024. Microsoft similarly expects capital expenditures to increase for AI infrastructure and training, in addition to supporting cloud offerings. Microsoft also emphasizes its mission to make AI broadly available and create AI-powered platforms and tools. NVIDIA (NVDA), on the other hand, details its AI investments through product-specific advancements and partnerships. This includes launching AI-powered gaming technologies like NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine for Games (a custom AI model foundry service), DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction, and TensorRT-LLM for Windows, and reaching a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games. In its Automotive segment, NVIDIA mentions a partnership to integrate new NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics.",
    "reasoning": "The information was extracted from the 2024 10-K filing excerpts for each company. For GOOGL, the relevant text mentions 'investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI' and 'expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services.' For MSFT, the excerpts state, 'We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training' and 'Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) available broadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.' For NVDA, the relevant sections include 'We announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine for Games, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform games and launched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. Additionally, we released TensorRT-LLM for Windows and launched GeForce RTX 40-Series SUPER GPUs. Gaming reached a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games and applications utilizing NVIDIA DLSS, ray tracing and other NVIDIA RTX technologies.' and 'In Automotive, we announced a partnership with MediaTek, which will develop mainstream automotive systems on chips for global OEMs integrating a new NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics.' The answer synthesizes these points to compare the nature of AI investments across the three companies.",
