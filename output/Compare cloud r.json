    "query": "Compare cloud revenue growth rates across all three companies from 2022 to 2023.",
    "answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud revenue grew by approximately 17.26%, and NVIDIA's Data Center revenue grew by approximately 41.38%. The growth rate for Google Cloud revenue from 2022 to 2023 cannot be calculated from the provided context as the base revenue for 2022 is not specified, only that it increased by $6.8 billion.",
    "reasoning": "For Microsoft, the Intelligent Cloud revenue was $74,965 million in 2022 and $87,907 million in 2023. The growth rate is calculated as (($87,907 - $74,965) / $74,965) * 100 = 17.26%. For NVIDIA, the Data Center revenue was $10,613 million in fiscal year 2022 (ending Jan 30, 2022) and $15,005 million in fiscal year 2023 (ending Jan 29, 2023). The growth rate is calculated as (($15,005 - $10,613) / $10,613) * 100 = 41.38%. For Google, the provided context states that 'Google Cloud revenues increased $6.8 billion from 2022 to 2023,' but it does not provide the absolute revenue figure for Google Cloud in 2022, which is necessary to calculate a percentage growth rate.",

In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA\u2019s automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference.

            "excerpt": "Gross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely relating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand expectations for these products, particularly for the expected demand in China. The inventory charges were comprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our demand expectations. Operating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction, were up 50% from a year ago. The increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering development costs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44\u00a0billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Market Platform Highlights",

These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago. Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer internet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare. Customers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data Center compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year. Gaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand. Professional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%. Automotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving platforms. Gross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.",
