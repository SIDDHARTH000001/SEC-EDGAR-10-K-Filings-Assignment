    "query": "Compare cloud revenue growth rates across all three companies from 2022 to 2023.",
    "answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the cloud revenue growth rates for the three companies were as follows:\n\n1. **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Microsoft Cloud revenue increased by 22%, from $91.2 billion in 2022 to $111.6 billion in 2023.\n\n2. **Google (GOOGL)**: Google Cloud's operating income increased significantly, but specific revenue growth rates are not provided in the context. However, the operating income for Google Cloud increased from $1,716 million in 2023 to $6,112 million in 2024, indicating strong growth.\n\n3. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment, which includes cloud services, saw a year-on-year increase led by growth from hyperscale customers and CSP partners, but specific percentage growth for cloud revenue is not provided.\n\nOverall, Microsoft showed a clear 22% growth in cloud revenue, while Google and NVIDIA demonstrated significant growth in their cloud-related segments, though exact percentages are not specified for these companies.",
    "reasoning": "The context provides specific growth rates for Microsoft's cloud revenue, which increased by 22% from 2022 to 2023. For Google and NVIDIA, while there is mention of growth in cloud-related segments, specific percentage growth rates for cloud revenue are not detailed. Google's operating income for its cloud segment increased significantly, suggesting strong growth, and NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment also grew, driven by cloud service agreements. Therefore, Microsoft's growth rate is clearly defined, whereas Google's and NVIDIA's growth is inferred from segment performance.",
