    "query": "What percentage of Google's revenue came from cloud in 2023?",
    "answer": "In 2023, Google Cloud's operating income was $1,716 million, and the total income from operations for Alphabet was $84,293 million. However, the specific revenue figures for Google Cloud in 2023 are not provided directly in the context. To determine the percentage of revenue from Google Cloud, we would need the specific revenue figure for Google Cloud, which is not available in the provided excerpts. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of Google's revenue that came from Google Cloud in 2023 based on the given context.",
    "reasoning": "The provided context includes operating income figures for Google Cloud and total income from operations for Alphabet, but it does not provide the specific revenue figures for Google Cloud in 2023. Without the actual revenue figures, it is not possible to calculate the percentage of Google's total revenue that came from Google Cloud.",

Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

            "excerpt": "Google other revenues Google other revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google other revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.

Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units.
