    "query": "Which company had the highest operating margin in 2023?",
    "answer": "NVIDIA had the highest operating margin in 2023, with an operating income expressed as a percentage of revenue at 15.6%.",
    "reasoning": "The context provides operating income as a percentage of revenue for NVIDIA and Alphabet (Google). NVIDIA's operating income for the year ended January 29, 2023, was 15.6% of revenue. Alphabet's total income from operations was $74,842 million, but the context does not provide the percentage of revenue for operating income, making direct comparison difficult. However, NVIDIA's operating margin is clearly stated, allowing us to conclude that NVIDIA had a higher operating margin compared to Alphabet based on the available data.",
