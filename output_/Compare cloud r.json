    "query": "Compare cloud revenue growth rates across all three companies from 2022 to 2023.",
    "answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the cloud revenue growth rates for the three companies are as follows:\n\n1. **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Microsoft Cloud revenue increased by 22% from $91.2 billion in 2022 to $111.6 billion in 2023.\n2. **Google (GOOGL)**: Google Cloud revenue increased by 37% from $7.1 billion in 2022.\n3. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment, which includes cloud services, saw a year-on-year increase led by growth from hyperscale customers, although a specific percentage for cloud revenue growth is not provided.\n\nThus, Google had the highest cloud revenue growth rate at 37%, followed by Microsoft at 22%. NVIDIA's specific cloud revenue growth rate is not detailed, but the segment showed growth.",
    "reasoning": "The context provides detailed revenue growth figures for Microsoft and Google, but NVIDIA's growth is described in terms of segment performance without specific cloud revenue figures. Microsoft and Google both have explicit growth percentages for their cloud services, allowing for direct comparison. Google's cloud revenue growth rate of 37% is higher than Microsoft's 22%, indicating stronger growth in Google's cloud services for the period. NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment growth is noted, but without a specific percentage for cloud revenue, it cannot be directly compared.",
